# Travel Diary Capstone Client
A hub for travel enthusiasts to store information and see public information stored by other users


### Working Prototype
You can access a working prototype of the React app here: https://travel-diary-capstone.vercel.app/ and Node app here: https://travel-diary-capstone.herokuapp.com/


### User Stories 
This app is for two types of users: a visitor and a logged-in user


###### Landing Page (Importance - Medium) (Est: 2h)
* as a visitor
* I want to understand what I can do with this app and view public information (or sign up, or log in)
* so I can decide if I want to use it


###### Login Page (Importance - High) (Est: 3h)
* As a returning register user
* I want to enter my password and username to use this app,
* So I can have access to my account.

###### Sign Up (Importance - High) (Est: 3h)
* As a visitor
* I want to register to use this app
* So I can create a personal account.

###### Dashboard Page (Importance - High) (Est: 2h)
* As a logged-in user,
* I want to be able to view all saved items and have the ability to check/un-check, edit, delete, or add an item,
* So I can decide what section I want to navigate to.

###### Add Item Page (Importance - High) (Est: 3h)
* As a logged-in user,
* I want to be able to enter a new keyword for a pinned map image, select (currency, language, rating, cost, type, visited), and add notes,
* So I can save my item to the dashboard.

###### Edit Item Page (Importance - High) (Est: 3h)
* As a logged-in user,
* I want to be able to edit an item, starting with all previously selected options,
* So I can update my item and save it to the dashboard.


### Functionality 
The app's functionality includes:
* A persistent nav-bar to navigate to home, dashboard, and log-in/log-out
* Every User has the ability to create an account, log in or log-out
* On the landing page, a visitor can view public information that was saved
* Each item will have the average or most common answer to each category displayed
* Public notes will be displayed under each item (if toggled to public)
* A logged in user should see a dashboard with all saved items and the ability to add an item
* Every item can be 'checked/un-checked' and will have a tag of 'Been there done that' or 'On the Bucket List'
* Selecting 'add item' will route to a new form 
* The 'add item' form allows the user to enter a new, mandatory, keyword
* A user's keyword should reroute to a google search and return a location
* A user's location search should pin a map image (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-started)
* If a user's search results don't work, show an error
* A user can select from a number of practical options to further describe the item (currency, language, grading system(1 - 5 stars), cost($, $$, $$$), type (historical, romantic, outdoor business, tourist, religious, sport, educational)
* There will be a mandatory selection for 'visited vs future plan'
* A section exists for personal notes at the bottom
* A user's searched location, map image, selections, and personal notes can be saved to a list item
* A user's personal notes can be toggled to either public or private
* Saved items can be edited and/or deleted 
* A succesful save/delete will reroute to the dashboard with the item added to the top
* Each new item added will also be added to the top of the public list on the home page
